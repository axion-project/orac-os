# ORAC-OS Kernel

The ORAC-OS kernel is the **semantic core** of the system:
- **Bootstraps the OS** and initializes semantic APIs.
- Provides an **LLM-native scheduler**, prioritizing context-aware agent workloads.
- Manages **distributed persistent memory** via a pluggable memory manager.
- Enforces **zero-trust security** with signed, cryptographic identities for processes.
- Provides a **semantic syscall interface** (agents can talk in code or natural language).

## Goals
1. Minimal but extensible: keep the base small, move complexity into modules.
2. Designed for agent orchestration: the kernel natively understands agent states and context.
3. Secure by default: cryptographic checks on all running code.

## Components
- **scheduler.c:** Multi-agent aware scheduler.
- **kernel.c:** Initialization, context management, and boot logic.
- **memory.c:** Tiered storage manager + vector search hooks.
- **ipc.c:** Secure inter-agent and inter-process communications.
- **security.c:** Implements process identity and zero-trust model.

## Build & Test

## Roadmap
- [ ] Semantic syscall definitions
