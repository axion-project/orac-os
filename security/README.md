# ORAC-OS Security Layer

Security in ORAC-OS isn't bolted on â€” it's built into the core.
Every process, agent, and memory operation is authenticated and verifiable.

## Principles
- **Zero-Trust by Default:** No implicit trust; all interactions require verification.
- **Cryptographic Identity:** Each process/agent has a signed ID; signatures checked at runtime.
- **Tamper-Evident Audit:** All critical actions logged with tamper-proof mechanisms.
- **Policy-Aware:** Ethical & access policies enforced at the kernel/security layer.

## Components
- **auth_manager.c:** Handles logins, tokens, and authentication flows.
- **identity_manager.c:** Creates/verifies process & agent cryptographic IDs.
- **crypto_engine.c:** Provides signing, hashing, encryption with pluggable backends.
- **policy_engine.c:** Enforces access and ethical rules (configurable).
- **audit_log.c:** Records critical ops; verifiable integrity.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement process identity creation and signature verification.
- [ ] Add secure boot and agent signing.
- [ ] Build tamper-evident, append-only audit log.
- [ ] Integrate policy engine with Civitas Machina ethical framework.

## Example Usage
- Agents signed with private keys; OS verifies signatures before execution.
- Memory persistence encrypted and signed; unauthorized changes rejected.
- Policy engine rejects tasks violating configured ethical/strategic rules.
