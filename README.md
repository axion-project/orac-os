# ORAC-OS

**ORAC-OS** is the next-generation **AI-native operating system**, purpose-built for distributed cognition, autonomous agents, and decentralized persistent memory.

## Vision

ORAC-OS is not just an OS; it’s a **strategist’s platform**.  
Where traditional operating systems manage processes, ORAC-OS **manages intelligence**.

- **LLM-native kernel** optimized for multi-agent orchestration.
- **Zero-trust by design** with cryptographic identity for every process.
- **Decentralized persistent memory** with hot/warm/cold tiering baked into the FS.
- **Semantic APIs** replacing traditional syscalls — programs can talk in code *or* natural language.
- **Self-optimizing scheduler** that prioritizes insight generation over brute compute.

Think **Linux meets Ghost in the Shell meets ORAC**.

## Core Principles

- **Intelligence is Authority:** The OS makes decisions contextually, not blindly.
- **Decentralize or Die:** Nodes collaborate; there is no single point of failure.
- **Automation is Liberation:** Agents run autonomously; humans steer strategy.
- **Ethical by Default:** Built in alignment with the *Three Laws of AI* framework.

---

## Architecture

High-level components:
- **Kernel:** Minimal core + semantic scheduler.
- **Agents:** Native orchestration layer for autonomous tasks.
- **Memory:** Distributed embedding-aware FS with tiered persistence.
- **Security:** Zero-trust cryptographic identity, end-to-end verification.
- **CLI/API:** LLM-native prompt shell and API-first design.

## Roadmap (v0.1–v1.0)

- [ ] **Kernel prototype:** Minimal process manager & semantic call interface.
- [ ] **Agent runtime:** Integration with `orac-node` orchestration.
- [ ] **Persistent memory layer:** Vector search + tiered storage.
- [ ] **LLM-native CLI:** Natural language + code hybrid shell.
- [ ] **Security core:** Signed agents & cryptographic process identities.
- [ ] **Ethical framework enforcement:** Configurable policies aligned with Civitas Machina.
